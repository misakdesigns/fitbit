Fitbit encourages developers to create original content that will delight users and help them achieve their fitness goals. Applications and clock faces (collectively, “Apps”) that you create can be submitted for use on the Fitbit platform. To share your creations, you may submit your Apps for review.

All Apps, whether submitted for private use or submitted for public availability in the App Gallery, must follow the guidelines below in order to protect our users, you, and Fitbit. These guidelines may change over time and the determination of whether an App complies with these guidelines shall be at Fitbit’s sole discretion.

Apps that are submitted for publication to all users are subject to review by Fitbit--approval of your App is at Fitbit’s sole discretion, but if your App is not approved Fitbit will use reasonable efforts to provide an explanation to you. Fitbit reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove or suspend any App from the Fitbit platform, including Apps that are not shared publicly. You and your App must comply with the Fitbit Platform Terms of Service and Fitbit App Distribution Agreement, which include the terms under which you can access Fitbit’s developer tools and APIs, distribute your App on the Fitbit platform, and use of data from Fitbit and Fitbit users. If we have to suspend or remove your App, we may prohibit you from further developing for the Fitbit platform.
